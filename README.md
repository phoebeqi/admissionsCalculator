# College Admissions Calculator

About the Project:

My project is a webpage where users can calculate their chances of being accepted into U.S. colleges. It is divided into 3 pages in total: the homoe page, where I briefly describe my project (and include an adorable baby meme); the calculator page, where the user is prompted to answer different questions and calculate a total score to find corresponding results; and the contact page, where I list my email and instagram (and a programmer meme).

My inspiration for this project originated from my own college admissions process last year, where I frantically researched the most important factors that admissions officers look into when reviewing college applications. It is meant to provide a brief overview of what college admissions officers look for when accepting students. The calculator includes four main categories: Demographics (high school background, course rigor); Test Scores (high school class rank, SAT scores, APs); Extracurriculars (number of extracurricular activities, leadership positions, international, national, regional, and school awards); and Lifestyle (hours of sleep per day, going Crimson red, and gathering positive feedback on CS50). At the end of the webpage the user can calculate their score and see what college tier they are sorted into.

This project is implemented with HTML, JS, and CSS files.
