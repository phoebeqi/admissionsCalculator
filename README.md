# College Admissions Calculator
About the Project:
My project is a webpage where users can calculate their chances of being accepted into U.S. colleges. It is divided into 3 pages in total: the homoe page, where I briefly describe my project (and include an adorable baby meme); the calculator page, where the user is prompted to answer different questions and calculate a total score to find corresponding results; and the contact page, where I list my email and instagram (and a programmer meme).

My inspiration for this project originated from my own college admissions process last year, where I frantically researched the most important factors that admissions officers look into when reviewing college applications.
