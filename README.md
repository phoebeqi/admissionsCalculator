# College Admissions Calculator
About the Project:
My project is a webpage where users can calculate their chances of being accepted into U.S. colleges. It is divided into 3 pages in total: the homoe page, where I briefly describe my project (and include an adorable baby meme); the calculator page, where the user is prompted to answer different questions and calculate a total score to find corresponding results; and the contact page, where I list my email and instagram (and a programmer meme).

My inspiration for this project originated from my own college admissions process last year, where I frantically researched the most important factors that admissions officers look into when reviewing college applications. 

This documentation is to be a userâ€™s manual for your project. Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the staff how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not be necessary for us to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you think we might have while testing your work.
